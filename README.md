# Welcome to my Immigration Employment Project! 

In this project I am exploring data compiled from the U.S. Department of Labor with two primary scopes: a longer term view over 2007-2021 and a more granular exploration over 2015-2021.

I analyze the trends found within successfull applicants, while considering the fact that all applicants have already faced success. This is due to the nature of the data - all applicants have already impressed an employer, passed the interviews, and received a job offer all as a foreign national.

The objective of the report is to provide an independent study into how an immigrant can have the most successfull chance at becoming employed in the United States. This is done through analyzing and interpretting the trends found within the most recent datasets. It is important to note, however, the changing nature of immigration and employment. What was the trend over the last seven years, may not repeat itself for the next seven years.
