# Immigration-Employment-Project
An exploration into H-1B and Green Card PERM data.

Welcome to my Immigration Employment Project! Please read the Final Report (attached in the repository) if you are interested in my research, methodology, and findings.

In this project I am exploring data compiled from the U.S. Department of Labor with two primary scopes: a longer term view over 2007-2021 and a more granular exploration over 2015-2021.

I analyze the trends found within successfull applicants, while considering the fact that all applicants have already faced success. This is due to the nature of the data - all applicants have already impressed an employer, passed the interviews, and received a job offer all as a foreign national.

The objective of the report is to provide an independent study into how an immigrant can have the most successfull chance at becoming employed in the United States.
