# Welcome to my Immigration Employment Project! 

In this project I explore PERM (Green Card) data compiled from the U.S. Department of Labor with two primary scopes: a longer term view over 2007-2021 and a more granular exploration over 2015-2021.

I analyze the trends found within successfull applicants, while considering the fact that all applicants have already faced success. This is due to the nature of the data - all applicants have already impressed an employer, passed the interviews, and received a job offer all as a foreign national. To provide further insight into the candidates that are chosen for Green Card sponsorship, I analyze not only features of candidates that eventually received a 'certified' case status, but also every candidate an employer submited an application for.

The objective of the report is to provide an independent study into how an immigrant can have the most successfull chance at becoming permanently employed (immigration through employment) in the United States. This is done through analyzing and interpretting the trends found within the total PERM data sets. It is important to note, however, the changing nature of immigration and employment. What was the trend over the last six years, may not repeat itself for the next six years.

The project is concluded with a classification deep learning model, that has an objective to estimate if a particular applicant will be successful and receive a certified status.
